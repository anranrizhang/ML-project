1. Train GAN
python GAN.py
2. Train VAE
python VAE.py
3. Output
After training, the output images of GAN is in GAN_result and the output of VAE is in VAE_result.
The architecture of GAN will be showed in discriminator_plot.png and generator_plot.png.
The architecture of VAE will be showed in VAE_plot.png.
